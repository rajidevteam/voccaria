## Our Collabborative Goals

Together, we'll develop the voice YOU desire in the quickest, healthiest way possible, equipping you with the tools necessary for safe, independent practice.

A tailored practice program will be designed for you during each lesson, complete with "homework" and a brief summary of areas to focus on. Practicing independently is as vital as learning alongside me!

Your progress will be monitored via the Your One Voice Discord server, where you'll have a personalized category and channels suited to your needs. Each lesson is recorded and made accessible privately, allowing us to track your progress over time. (Alternative options are available if you prefer not to use Discord.)

- Our primary focus is on mastering techniques to ensure safe, independent practice. Supervised practice is limited to the lesson duration.

## Message from Mia (from old website)

I have been offering voice lessons on a paid and pro bono basis since 2019. Continuously honing my skills, I have trained with teachers Silva Makamian (opera, pop) and Aliki Katriou (distortion) and completed the New York Vocal Coaching Teacher Training Course. My approach, heavily inspired by Feldenkrais, is now further enhanced through my enrollment in the Robert Sussuma Teacher Training Program. Additionally, I actively study Brian Gill's work and learn from the teachers he has trained.

My teaching approach emphasizes minimizing tension, enabling the body to produce powerful, natural sounds. I specialize in coaching the highest registers of the voice, extending range and tone to their full potential, and cultivating an effortless mixed voice—my unique "One Voice" approach.

Currently in my fourth and final year pursuing a degree in Psychology and Vocal Pedagogy, I am well-equipped to teach individuals with general joint hypermobility, GERD, ADHD/ADD, and those on the autism spectrum. I firmly believe that posture, physical well-being, and mental health are essential for both exceptional singing and a fulfilling life.

As a voice teacher, I help beginners grasp the fundamentals efficiently and effortlessly. As a vocal coach, I specialize in Pop and confidently teach all microphone genres.

I can't wait to work with you!

## More message from Mia

Before receiving formal pedagogical training, I learned from the internet and became well-acquainted with the online resources available for those unable to afford voice lessons. I understand the challenges of not having access to real-time, one-on-one guidance. My work is dedicated to providing FREE lessons without any gimmicks or attempts to sell a program. I have shared my unique approaches entirely free of charge on the Discord server I created, which currently has over 5,000 members.

My teaching method is straightforward—fewer mind tricks, more focus on anatomy, and direct instruction—providing the foundational tools to develop a professional voice quickly. I also guide you on exactly what and how to practice to achieve your goals as swiftly as possible.

A wealth of free resources, including handpicked YouTube videos from across the web and text written by me, are well-organized and available for you to learn independently. You can always ask questions, submit recordings, and receive feedback at no cost. There's a practice routine suitable for both beginners and advanced students, along with homework channels featuring specific instructions for submitting your attempts, ensuring everything progresses smoothly—from posture and breathing to mixing and range extension exercises.

I do not withhold any information, whether you participate in free or paid lessons. The paid lessons offer greater personalization due to the additional time available.
